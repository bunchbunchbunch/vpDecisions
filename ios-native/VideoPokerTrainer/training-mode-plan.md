## Lesson 1: Dealt Hands That Pay — If You're Already Winning, Keep It

** John Reviewed ** 
**Key concept:** A "pat" hand is any dealt hand that already pays. Two Pair and above should almost always be kept intact. 

**What the player should learn:**
- Recognize all paying hands (Jacks or Better through Royal Flush)
- How to keep the cards in the paying hand

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Not seeing the dealt hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Jh Th 9h 8h 7h | All 5 | Straight flush — 5 in a row and suited |
| 2 | Ks Kd Kh 7c 7s | All 5 | Full house — always keep |
| 3 | Th 9h 6h 3h 2h | All 5 | Flush — all the same suit |
| 4 | Ts 9d 8c 7h 6s | All 5 | Straight — 5 in a row |
| 5 | Qh Qd 8s 8c 3d | Qh Qd 8s 8c | Two pair — Keep the two pair, throw away the extra card |
| 6 | 8s 8h 8c Ad Kd | 8s 8h 8c | Three of a kind — drop the kickers, draw 2 |

## Lesson 2: Pairs — Your Bread and Butter

** John Reviewed ** 

**Key concept:** Pairs drive the strategy in Jacks or Better. A high pair (JJ, QQ, KK, AA) already pays. A low pair (22–TT) doesn't pay, but it's still better than almost every drawing hand. Never underestimate a pair.

**What the player should learn:**
- High pair = paying hand. Hold it and draw 3.
- Low pair = not paying, but still a strong hold. Keep it over single high cards, inside straight draws, and 3-card flush draws.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a "kicker" (e.g., holding a King alongside a pair of 5s)
- Breaking a low pair to hold two unsuited high cards

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Qh Qd 7s 4c 2d | Qh Qd | High pair — it already pays, hold it |
| 2 | 6h 6d As Kc 3s | 6h 6d | Low pair is better than unsuited AK — this surprises beginners |
| 3 | 9s 9d Jh Tc 3c | 9s 9d | Low pair — don't be tempted by J or JT |
| 4 | Ks Kd 7h 3h 2h | Ks Kd | High pair is better than 3 to a flush |
| 5 | 4c 4d Ah Qh 9c | 4c 4d | Low pair is better than AQ unsuited |

## Lesson 3: Straight Draws - Level 1

*John reviewed*
**Key concept:** Not all straight draws are equal. An open-ended straight draw can be completed on either end (8 outs), while an inside straight draw needs one specific rank (4 outs). This distinction matters — open-ended draws are roughly twice as likely to hit.

**What the player should learn:**
- Open-ended straight draw (e.g., 7-8-9-T): Keep open-ended straight draw over high card
- Inside straight draw (e.g., 5-6-_-8-9): only 4 cards fill the gap, much weaker.  Never keep it with all low cards.
- Any pair is better than an open-ended straight draw.


**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Treating inside straight draws as valuable (they're usually not)
- Breaking a low pair for an inside straight draw
- Not recognizing that A-2-3-4 is an inside draw, not open-ended

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Jh Ts 9d 8c 3h | Jh Ts 9d 8c | Open-ended with a high card — good draw |
| 2 | 9h 8d 7c 6s Ks | 9h 8d 7c 6s | Open-ended — the K isn't helping |
| 3 | 5h 5d 8s 6c 7d | 5h 5d | Low pair is better than open-ended with no high cards |
| 4 | Jh Td Js 8c 9h | Jh Js | Keep the high pair |
| 5 | 8h 7d 5c 4s Kd | Kd | Inside draw (8-7-_-5-4) loses to a single high card |
| 6 | 6s 6d Jh Tc 9d | 6s 6d | Low pair is better than an inside straight draw |
| 7 | Th 9d 8c 6s 2d | Draw All | Never keep an inside straight draw |
| 8 | Ah 2d 3c 4s 9h | Ah | A-2-3-4 is an inside draw — just keep the Ace |

---

## Lesson 4: The 4-Card Flush — A Powerful Draw
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Four cards to a flush is one of the strongest drawing hands in the game. You have roughly a 1-in-5 chance of completing it (9 remaining suited cards out of 47). A 4-flush is better than a low pair but not a high pair.

**What the player should learn:**
- 4 to a flush is better than low pair: keep flush draw
- A high pair is better than 4 to a flush: keep high pair (JJ+)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low pair instead of drawing to the 4-flush
- Keeping two off-suit high cards instead of the 4-flush
- Breaking a high pair for a 4-flush (the high pair is better)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah 9h 6h 3h Kc | Ah 9h 6h 3h | 4 to a flush — discard the off-suit King |
| 2 | 8h 5h 3h 2h 8d | 8h 5h 3h 2h | 4 to a flush is better the pair of 8s |
| 3 | Qh 9h 7h 4h Ks | Qh 9h 7h 4h | 4 to a flush is better than the off-suit KQ |
| 4 | Kh Th 6h 2h Qs | Kh Th 6h 2h | 4 flush is better than a single high card (Q) |
| 5 | Jh 8h 4h 2h 5c | Jh 8h 4h 2h | 4 to a flush — even though J is high, the flush draw is much better |
| 6 | Qs Qd 8h 5h 3h | Qs Qd | High pair Queens is better than 3 to a flush — only 3 suited cards |
| 7 | Ts 6s 4s 2s 6d | Ts 7s 4s 2s | 4 to a flush is better than a low pair of 6s |
| 8 | Jd Jh 9h 7h 4h | Jd Js | High pair of Jacks is better than 4 to a flush |

## Lesson 5: Unsuited High Card Showdowns
*John Reviewed*


**Key concept:** When you have multiple unsuited high cards and no better draw, which ones you keep matters. The hierarchy is QJ > KJ, KQ > AJ, AQ, AK. With 3 unsuited high cards, keep only the best 2 — and that usually means dropping the Ace or the King.

**What the player should learn:**
- QJ is the best unsuited 2-card combo because it participates in the most straights
- With AQJ unsuited: hold QJ, drop the A
- With AKQ unsuited: hold KQ, drop the A
- With AKJ unsuited: hold KJ, drop the A
- KQJ is the only 3 high card hand where you keep all 3

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping AK because "those are the two highest cards"
- Holding all 3 unsuited high cards (AKQ, AQJ, AKJ) — trim to 2 in these cases
- Thinking the Ace is the most valuable high card (it restricts straight possibilities)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Qs Jd 8c 5h 3s | Qs Jd | QJ unsuited — the best 2-card unsuited combo |
| 2 | As Qd 8c 5h 3s | As Qd | AQ unsuited — weaker than QJ, but still hold both |
| 3 | Ah Qd Jc 6s 3h | Qd Jc | AQJ unsuited — drop the A, keep QJ |
| 4 | As Kd Qs 7c 3h | Kd Qs | AKQ unsuited — drop the A, keep KQ |
| 5 | Ah Kd Jc 6s 2h | Kd Jc | AKJ unsuited — drop the A, keep KJ |
| 6 | Ks Jd 8c 5h 2s | Ks Jd | KJ unsuited — solid 2-card hold |
| 7 | As Kd 8c 5h 3s | As Kd | AK unsuited |
| 8 | Ks Qd 9c 6h 2s | Ks Qd | KQ unsuited — weaker than QJ but stronger than AQ |
| 9 | Kh Qd Js 7c 2h | Qd Js | Keep KQJ - This is the one time you keep 3 high cards |

---

## Lesson 6: High Card Hands — The Subtleties
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** When you have no pair and no strong draw, the specific high cards you hold matter more than you'd think. Suited is better than unsuited. And counterintuitively, QJ is better than AQ because QJ can participate in more straights.

**What the player should learn:**
- Suited high cards (Qh Jh) >> unsuited high cards (Qs Jd) because of flush potential
- The 2-card unsuited hierarchy: QJ > KJ, KQ > AJ, AQ, AK
- Why: QJ makes straights in 3 positions (AKQJT, KQJT9, QJT98), AK makes only 1 (AKQJT)
- Never hold 3 unsuited high cards except for KQJ

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping AQ over QJ (the Ace restricts straight possibilities)
- Holding 3 unsuited high cards (AKQ) instead of the best 2 (KQ)
- Not valuing suited high cards enough

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | As 9d 7c 4h 2s | As | Lone Ace — only option when nothing connects |
| 2 | Jd 8c 5h 3s 2d | Jd | Lone Jack — only option when nothing connects |
| 3 | Qh Jh 8c 5d 3s | Qh Jh | Suited QJ — best 2-card high card combo |
| 4 | Qs Jd 8c 5h 3d | Qs Jd | Unsuited QJ — still the best unsuited 2-card combo |
| 5 | As Kd 8c 5h 3s | As Kd | AK unsuited |
| 6 | Ah Qd Jc 6s 3h | Qd Jc | 3 unsuited high cards — drop the A, keep QJ |
| 7 | Kh Jh 9c 5d 2s | Kh Jh | Suited KJ — the suit makes this much stronger |
| 8 | 8s Jd Qc Ad 3d | Ad Jd | suited AJ — better than QJ offsuit |
| 9 | Kd Qh Jd 6c 2h | Kd Jd | Suited KJ — better than QJ offsuit |
| 10 | Ah Kd Qs 7c 3d | Kd Qs | 3 high cards — drop the Ace, keep KQ
| 11 | 8s Jc Kd Ad 3d | Ad Kd | Suited AK — better than KJ offsuit ||

## Lesson 7: Three to a Royal — When to Break Good Hands
*John Reviewed* 
**Key concept:** Three to a Royal Flush (3 cards T-or-higher of the same suit) is so powerful that it's correct to break a low pair and 4 to a straight.  However, a high pair is better than 3 to the royal.

**What the player should learn:**
- 3 to a Royal = 3 cards Ten-or-higher, all the same suit (e.g., Kh Qh Th)
- 3 to a Royal is better than: 4 to a  flush, 4 to a straight.
- 3 to a Royal is not as good as: two pair, trips, 4 to a straight flush
- You're not just chasing the Royal — on the redraw you can also hit a flush, straight, or pair

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low pair instead of 3 to a Royal
- Confusing 3 to a Royal (very strong) with 3 to a straight flush (much weaker)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah Kh Qh 7d 3c | Ah Kh Qh | 3 to a Royal — much better than 2 high cards |
| 2 | Kh Kd Kc Qh Jh | Kh Kd Kc | Trips are better than 3 to a Royal — keep the three Kings |
| 3 | Ah Kh Th 9d 4c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal — discard the garbage |
| 4 | Qh Jh Th 8c 5d | Qh Jh Th | 3 to a Royal — straightforward |
| 5 | Ks Qh Js Ts 4h | Ks Js Ts | 3 to a Royal in spades — don't keep the open-ended straight draw |
| 6 | Ah Kh Th 9h 3c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than 4 to a flush — yes, drop the 9h |
| 7 | Jh Tc Qh Th 6d | Qh Jh Th | Break the pair of Tens for 3 to a Royal |
| 8 | Kh Qh Th 8s 8d | Kh Qh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than a low pair of 8s |
| 9 | Kh Qh Th 9h 8d | Kh Qh Th | 4 to a Straight flush is better than 3 to a Royal|

## Lesson 8: Garbage Hands & Full Strategy Review

**Key concept:** Sometimes you're dealt nothing — no pair, no draw, no high cards. Knowing when to throw away all 5 cards is a skill. This lesson also puts everything together.

**What the player should learn:**
- If you have nothing useful, discard all 5 and draw fresh
- A single high card (J, Q, K, A) is still better than keeping random low cards
- Don't keep 3 unsuited low cards hoping for a straight or flush — it won't happen often enough
- Review the full holding hierarchy from Lesson 1 through Lesson 7

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping random suited low cards (e.g., 7h 4h 2h) — 3 to a flush is almost never worth it
- Not recognizing true garbage (no pair, no draw, no high cards)
- Getting "attached" to an almost-hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 8c 6d 4h 3s 2c | Nothing | Pure garbage — discard all 5 |
| 2 | 9h 7d 5c 3s 2h | Nothing | No pair, no draw, no high card — toss it |
| 3 | Jh 4d 3c 2s 8h | Jh | Lone Jack — better than garbage |
| 4 | Qh 9h 7d 4c 2s | Qh | Lone Queen — only high card in the hand |
| 5 | 7h 7d Kc 6s 2c | 7h 7d | Review: low pair is better than a single high card |
| 6 | Kd Td 8s 5c 2h | Kd Td | Suited K-T has flush + straight potential |
| 7 | As Kh Qd Jc 4h | Kh Qd Jc | 4 unsuited high cards — keep the best 3, drop the Ace |
| 8 | 9d 7c 5h 3s 2d | Nothing | Garbage — fresh 5 cards is the best play |
| 9 | Th 6h 4h 3c 2s | Th | A Ten is NOT a high card in JoB — but slightly better than all garbage |
| 10 | Ah Kh 9d 6c 3s | Ah Kh | Suited AK — the suit makes this worth holding together |

---

## Lesson 9: 3 to a Royal vs. 4 to a Flush — The Counterintuitive Break

**Key concept:** When you have 3 suited high cards (a 3-Royal draw) plus a 4th suited low card (making a 4-flush), you should break the 4-flush and keep only the 3-Royal. Throwing away a suited card feels wrong, but the Royal draw's massive payout makes it correct.

**What the player should learn:**
- If your 4-flush contains 3 cards that are Ten-or-higher of the same suit, hold only those 3 (the 3-Royal)
- 3 to a Royal ranks ABOVE 4 to a flush in the strategy hierarchy
- The Royal's 800:1 payout justifies discarding a suited card that would give you a better flush chance
- If you only have 2 or fewer Royal cards in your 4-flush, keep all 4 suited cards

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping the 4-flush because "I already have 4 suited cards, why throw one away?"
- Not spotting the 3-Royal hiding inside a 4-flush
- Confusing this with 4 to a Royal (which is even stronger — always hold 4 to a Royal)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Kh Qh Th 7h 3c | Kh Qh Th | 3 to a Royal — drop the 7h, don't keep the 4-flush |
| 2 | Ah Kh Th 9h 5c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than the 4-flush (Ah Kh Th 9h) |
| 3 | Qh Jh Th 4h 8c | Qh Jh Th | 3 to a Royal — the 4h is tempting but wrong to keep |
| 4 | Kh 9h 6h 3h Qc | Kh 9h 6h 3h | 4 to a flush — only 1 Royal card (K), no 3-Royal available |
| 5 | Ah Kh Qh 5h Jd | Ah Kh Qh | 3 to a Royal (AKQ) — drop the 5h AND the Jd |
| 6 | Jh 8h 5h 2h Kc | Jh 8h 5h 2h | 4 to a flush — only 1 Royal card (J), keep the flush draw |
| 7 | Ah Qh Th 6h 9c | Ah Qh Th | 3 to a Royal — break the 4-flush |
| 8 | Kh Jh Th 3h 9d | Kh Jh Th | 3 to a Royal (KJT) — drop the 3h |
| 9 | Qh 9h 7h 4h Ks | Qh 9h 7h 4h | 4 to a flush — only 1 Royal card (Q), keep all 4 suited |
| 10 | Ah Kh Jh 2h 5c | Ah Kh Jh | 3 to a Royal (AKJ) — drop the 2h |

---

## Lesson 10: Suited High Cards — The Power of the Suit

**Key concept:** When two high cards share a suit, they become dramatically stronger than the same cards unsuited. A suited combo has flush potential on top of pair and straight potential. Suited AK is a strong hold, even though unsuited AK is one of the weakest high card combos.

**What the player should learn:**
- Suited high cards always beat the same cards unsuited
- AK suited is a strong hold (flush + straight potential) — unlike AK unsuited which is weak
- QJ suited is the best suited 2-card combo
- Suited 2-card combos beat unsuited 2-card combos even when the unsuited combo has "better" ranks
- Example: Kh Jh (suited) is better than Qs Jd (unsuited QJ)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Treating suited AK the same as unsuited AK (suited is much stronger)
- Breaking a suited high card combo to hold an unsuited one with "better" individual cards
- Not checking if your high cards share a suit before deciding what to hold

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah Kh 9c 5d 3s | Ah Kh | Suited AK — strong hold (unlike unsuited AK) |
| 2 | Qh Jh 8c 5d 3s | Qh Jh | Suited QJ — the best suited 2-card combo |
| 3 | Kh Jh 9c 5d 2s | Kh Jh | Suited KJ — much stronger than unsuited KJ |
| 4 | Ah Kh Qd 7c 3s | Ah Kh | Suited AK is better than the unsuited Q — the suit wins |
| 5 | Ks Qh Jh 8c 3d | Qh Jh | Suited QJ is better than unsuited K — suit trumps rank |
| 6 | Ah Qh 9c 5d 3s | Ah Qh | Suited AQ — the suit makes the Ace worth keeping |
| 7 | Kh Th 9c 6d 2s | Kh Th | Suited KT — even a Ten is worth holding when suited with a high card |
| 8 | As Kd Qh Jh 5c | Qh Jh | Suited QJ is better than unsuited AK — suit > rank |
| 9 | Jh Th 9c 5d 2s | Jh Th | Suited JT — straight flush potential plus flush plus straight |
| 10 | Ah Kh Qs Jd 4c | Ah Kh | Suited AK is better than unsuited QJ — both are 2-card holds, suit wins |

---

## Lesson 11: 4 to Broadway — Inside Straights with High Cards

**Key concept:** Normally, inside straight draws are weak. But when all 4 cards are Broadway cards (Ten through Ace), the draw gets extra value: every card can pair up for a paying hand (Jacks or Better), and you're drawing to a straight. Hands like KQJT (open-ended) and AKQJ (inside) are stronger than you'd think.

**What the player should learn:**
- KQJT is an open-ended straight with 3 high cards — one of the strongest non-pair draws
- AKQJ, AKQT, AKJT, AQJT are inside straights with 3+ high cards — hold all 4
- These 4-card Broadway holds rank above holding just 2 unsuited high cards
- The key is having 4 cards in straight sequence (or 1 gap) — if the cards don't connect, hold 2
- KQJT open-ended is stronger than AKQJ inside, but both are holds

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding only QJ from AKQJ (the 4-card inside straight is better than 2 high cards)
- Not recognizing KQJT as an open-ended straight (it can catch an A or 9)
- Treating all inside straights the same — Broadway inside straights are special because of high card payout potential

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Kd Qh Jc Ts 4d | Kd Qh Jc Ts | KQJT open-ended — one of the best straight draws |
| 2 | As Kd Qh Jc 5s | As Kd Qh Jc | AKQJ inside straight — hold all 4, better than just QJ |
| 3 | As Kd Qh Tc 6s | As Kd Qh Tc | AKQT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs J) |
| 4 | As Kd Jh Tc 5s | As Kd Jh Tc | AKJT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs Q) |
| 5 | Ah Qd Jc Ts 6h | Ah Qd Jc Ts | AQJT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs K) |
| 6 | Kh Qd Js 8c 3h | Qd Js | KQJ with a gap (no T) — not a straight draw, just hold QJ |
| 7 | Ah Kd Qs 8c 3h | Kd Qs | AKQ with a gap — not a straight draw, hold KQ |
| 8 | Kd Qh Jc Ts 3s | Kd Qh Jc Ts | KQJT — even with a suited 3, the open-ended straight wins |
| 9 | As Kd Qh Jc 2c | As Kd Qh Jc | AKQJ — 4 Broadway cards in sequence beat holding just 2 |
| 10 | Ah Kd Jc 8s 4h | Kd Jc | AKJ with a gap — no straight draw, hold KJ and drop the Ace |

| 1 | Pat Hands | Keep paying hands; learn the 4-to-Royal exception | Easy |
| 2 | Pairs | High pairs pay; low pairs still beat most draws | Easy |
| 3 | Straight Draws | Open-ended vs. inside; Ace makes it inside | Medium |
| 4 | Flush Draws | 4 to a flush is powerful; is better than low pairs | Medium |
| 5 | Unsuited High Card Showdowns | QJ > KJ > KQ > AQ > AK; drop the Ace from 3 | Hard |
| 6 | High Cards | Suited > unsuited; QJ > AK; drop the Ace | Hard |
| 7 | 3 to a Royal | Break pairs, flushes, and straights for 3-Royal | Hard |
| 8 | Garbage & Review | When to discard all 5; full strategy test | Mixed |
| 9 | 3-Royal vs. 4-Flush | Break the 4-flush to keep 3 to a Royal | Hard |
| 10 | Suited High Cards | Suited AK is strong; suited is better than unsuited | Medium |
| 11 | 4 to Broadway | Inside straights with all high cards are special holds | Hard |
| 12 | Royal Draws | 4 to Royal beats almost everything; 3 to Royal beats low pair & 4-flush | Hard |
| 13 | Inside Straights with High Cards | More high cards = stronger inside straight draw | Medium |
| 14 | The Lone High Card | Single J/Q/K/A beats garbage; Ten is not a high card | Easy |


## Lesson 12: Royal Draws — Chasing the Jackpot

**Key concept:** Royal flush draws are the most valuable draws in the game because of the massive 800:1 payout (4000 coins at max bet). 4 to a Royal beats almost everything — you should break a flush, straight, two pair, trips, or even a full house for it. 3 to a Royal is also powerful: it beats a low pair and 4 to a flush.

**What the player should learn:**
- 4 to a Royal beats everything except a pat Straight Flush or Royal Flush
- 4 to a Royal: break a flush, straight, two pair, trips, or full house for it
- 3 to a Royal is better than 4 to a flush — break the flush draw
- 3 to a Royal is better than a low pair — break the pair
- Only a pat Straight Flush (50:1) is worth keeping over 4 to a Royal

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a flush instead of going for 4 to a Royal
- Keeping two pair or trips instead of 4 to a Royal
- Not recognizing when you have 4 to a Royal inside a made hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Th Jh Qh Kh 3h | Th Jh Qh Kh | 4 to a Royal — break the flush |
| 2 | As Ks Qs Js 9d | As Ks Qs Js | 4 to a Royal — discard the 9, draw for the Ts |
| 3 | Ah Kh Qh Jh 9h | Ah Kh Qh Jh | 4 to a Royal — break the straight flush draw to go for the Royal |
| 4 | Td Jd Qd Kd 7s | Td Jd Qd Kd | 4 to a Royal — even without a pair, this is a powerful draw |
| 5 | Ts Js Qs Ks Kd | Ts Js Qs Ks | 4 to a Royal — break the pair of Kings for the Royal draw |
| 6 | Kh Qh Th 7h 5d | Kh Qh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than keeping the 4-flush (Kh Qh Th 7h) |
| 7 | 5s 5d Ah Kh Qh | Ah Kh Qh | 3 to a Royal is better than the low pair of 5s |
| 8 | 8h 8d Jh Th Qh | Jh Th Qh | 3 to a Royal is better than the low pair of 8s |
| 9 | Tc Jc Qc Kc 9c | Tc Jc Qc Kc 9c | Keep the straight flush! Only a pat straight flush beats 4 to a Royal |
| 10 | Ah Kh Jh 4d 2c | Ah Kh Jh | 3 to a Royal — much better than keeping a single high card |

---

## Lesson 13: Inside Straights — When High Cards Make the Difference

**Key concept:** Inside straight draws are usually weak (only 4 outs). But the number of high cards in the draw changes everything. An inside straight with 3 or 4 high cards is worth holding because each high card can pair for a paying hand. An inside straight with 0-1 high cards is almost never worth keeping.

**What the player should learn:**
- Inside straight with 4 high cards (AKQJ): strong hold — beats holding just 2 high cards
- Inside straight with 3 high cards (KQJ9, AQJ9, etc.): still worth holding all 4
- Inside straight with 2 high cards (QJT8, KJT8): borderline — usually just hold the high cards
- Inside straight with 0-1 high cards (9875, T986): never hold — discard all or keep a lone high card
- The more high cards in the draw, the more "backup" outs you have (pairing J, Q, K, A pays)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding an inside straight with no high cards (e.g., 9-8-_-6-5) — this is almost never correct
- Not recognizing that KQJ9 is a valuable 4-card hold (inside straight, 3 high cards)
- Treating all inside straights the same — high cards make a huge difference

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|

## Lesson 14: The Lone High Card — Better Than Nothing

**Key concept:** The most common situation in video poker is holding a single high card (J, Q, K, or A) surrounded by garbage. When your hand has no pair, no meaningful draw, and only one high card, that lone high card is your best play. Hold it and draw 4 new cards — you have a roughly 1-in-5 chance of pairing it for a Jacks or Better payout.

**What the player should learn:**
- A single J, Q, K, or A is always worth holding when nothing better exists
- Draw 4 new cards — a fresh draw gives you many chances to improve
- Don't keep low cards alongside the high card — they don't help
- A Ten is NOT a high card in Jacks or Better (pairing a Ten doesn't pay)
- A lone high card beats weak draws like 3 to a flush or an inside straight with no high cards

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low card as a "kicker" next to the high card (e.g., holding K-7 instead of just K)
- Chasing a 3-card flush draw instead of holding the lone high card
- Holding a Ten thinking it's a high card (it isn't — Jacks or Better means J is the minimum)
- Discarding everything when you have a lone Jack (the Jack has real value)

**Practice Hands:**

| 1 | Ah 9c 7d 4s 2h | Ah | Lone Ace — keep it, draw 4 new cards |
| 2 | Ks 8d 6c 3h 2s | Ks | Lone King — your only high card, don't keep the garbage |
| 3 | Qd 9h 7c 4s 2d | Qd | Lone Queen — hold it and draw 4 |
| 4 | Jh 8c 5d 3s 2h | Jh | Lone Jack — the minimum card that can make a paying pair |

| 6 | Th 8d 6c 3s 2h | Draw All | A Ten is NOT a high card — pairing it won't pay, discard everything |
| 7 | Ah 9d 6d 3d 2s | Ah | Keep the Ace — don't chase the 3-card flush in diamonds |
| 8 | Qh 9c 8d 6s 5h | Qh | Lone Queen beats the inside straight (9-8-_-6-5) |
| 9 | Js 7h 5c 4d 2s | Js | Lone Jack — it looks like nothing but the Jack gives you a shot |
