## Lesson 1: Dealt Hands That Pay — If You're Already Winning, Keep It

** John Reviewed ** 
**Key concept:** A "pat" hand is any dealt hand that already pays. Two Pair and above should almost always be kept intact. 

**What the player should learn:**
- Recognize all paying hands (Jacks or Better through Royal Flush)
- How to keep the cards in the paying hand

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Not seeing the dealt hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Jh Th 9h 8h 7h | All 5 | Straight flush — 5 in a row and suited |
| 2 | Ks Kd Kh 7c 7s | All 5 | Full house — always keep |
| 3 | Th 9h 6h 3h 2h | All 5 | Flush — all the same suit |
| 4 | Ts 9d 8c 7h 6s | All 5 | Straight — 5 in a row |
| 5 | Qh Qd 8s 8c 3d | Qh Qd 8s 8c | Two pair — Keep the two pair, throw away the extra card |
| 6 | 8s 8h 8c Ad Kd | 8s 8h 8c | Three of a kind — drop the kickers, draw 2 |

## Lesson 2: Pairs — Your Bread and Butter

** John Reviewed ** 

**Key concept:** Pairs drive the strategy in Jacks or Better. A high pair (JJ, QQ, KK, AA) already pays. A low pair (22–TT) doesn't pay, but it's still better than almost every drawing hand. Never underestimate a pair.

**What the player should learn:**
- High pair = paying hand. Hold it and draw 3.
- Low pair = not paying, but still a strong hold. Keep it over single high cards, inside straight draws, and 3-card flush draws.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a "kicker" (e.g., holding a King alongside a pair of 5s)
- Breaking a low pair to hold two unsuited high cards

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Qh Qd 7s 4c 2d | Qh Qd | High pair — it already pays, hold it |
| 2 | 6h 6d As Kc 3s | 6h 6d | Low pair is better than unsuited AK — this surprises beginners |
| 3 | 9s 9d Jh Tc 3c | 9s 9d | Low pair — don't be tempted by J or JT |
| 4 | Ks Kd 7h 3h 2h | Ks Kd | High pair is better than 3 to a flush |
| 5 | 4c 4d Ah Qh 9c | 4c 4d | Low pair is better than AQ unsuited |

## Lesson 3: The Lone High Card — Better Than Nothing

*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** The most common situation in video poker is holding a single high card (J, Q, K, or A) surrounded by garbage. When your hand has no pair, no meaningful draw, and only one high card, that lone high card is your best play. Hold it and draw 4 new cards — you have a roughly 1-in-5 chance of pairing it for a Jacks or Better payout.

**What the player should learn:**
- A single J, Q, K, or A is always worth holding when nothing better exists
- Draw 4 new cards — a fresh draw gives you many chances to improve
- Don't keep low cards alongside the high card — they don't help
- A Ten is NOT a high card in Jacks or Better (pairing a Ten doesn't pay)
- A lone high card beats weak draws like 3 to a flush or an inside straight with no high cards

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low card as a "kicker" next to the high card (e.g., holding K-7 instead of just K)
- Chasing a 3-card flush draw instead of holding the lone high card
- Holding a Ten thinking it's a high card (it isn't — Jacks or Better means J is the minimum)
- Discarding everything when you have a lone Jack (the Jack has real value)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah 9c 7d 4s 2h | Ah | Lone Ace — keep it, draw 4 new cards |
| 2 | Ks 8d 6c 3h 2s | Ks | Lone King — your only high card, don't keep the garbage |
| 3 | Qd 9h 7c 4s 2d | Qd | Lone Queen — hold it and draw 4 |
| 4 | Jh 8c 5d 3s 2h | Jh | Lone Jack — the minimum card that can make a paying pair |
| 5 | Kh 9h 7d 4c 2s | Kh | Lone King — don't be tempted by 2 hearts, that's not a draw |
| 6 | Th 8d 6c 3s 2h | Draw All | A Ten is NOT a high card — pairing it won't pay, discard everything |
| 7 | Ah 9d 6d 3d 2s | Ah | Keep the Ace — don't chase the 3-card flush in diamonds |
| 8 | Qh 9c 8d 6s 5h | Qh | Lone Queen beats the inside straight (9-8-_-6-5) |
| 9 | Js 7h 5c 4d 2s | Js | Lone Jack — it looks like nothing but the Jack gives you a shot |
| 10 | Kd 8c 6h 4s 2d | Kd | Lone King — pure garbage around it, hold the King and draw 4 |

## Lesson 4: Unsuited High Card Showdowns
*John Reviewed*


**Key concept:** When you have multiple unsuited high cards and no better draw, which ones you keep matters. The hierarchy is QJ > KJ, KQ > AJ, AQ, AK. With 3 unsuited high cards, keep only the best 2 — and that usually means dropping the Ace or the King.

**What the player should learn:**
- QJ is the best unsuited 2-card combo because it participates in the most straights
- With AQJ unsuited: hold QJ, drop the A
- With AKQ unsuited: hold KQ, drop the A
- With AKJ unsuited: hold KJ, drop the A
- KQJ is the only 3 high card hand where you keep all 3

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping AK because "those are the two highest cards"
- Holding all 3 unsuited high cards (AKQ, AQJ, AKJ) — trim to 2 in these cases
- Thinking the Ace is the most valuable high card (it restricts straight possibilities)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Qs Jd 8c 5h 3s | Qs Jd | QJ unsuited — the best 2-card unsuited combo |
| 2 | As Qd 8c 5h 3s | As Qd | AQ unsuited — weaker than QJ, but still hold both |
| 3 | Ah Qd Jc 6s 3h | Qd Jc | AQJ unsuited — drop the A, keep QJ |
| 4 | Ac Kd Qs 7c 3h | Kd Qs | AKQ unsuited — drop the A, keep KQ |
| 5 | Ah Kd Jc 6s 2h | Kd Jc | AKJ unsuited — drop the A, keep KJ |
| 6 | Ks Jd 8c 5h 2s | Ks Jd | KJ unsuited — solid 2-card hold |
| 7 | As Kd 8c 5h 3s | As Kd | AK unsuited |
| 8 | Ks Qd 9c 6h 2s | Ks Qd | KQ unsuited — weaker than QJ but stronger than AQ |
| 9 | Kh Qd Js 7c 2h | Qd Js | Keep KQJ - This is the one time you keep 3 high cards |

---

## Lesson 5: High Card Hands — The Subtleties
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** When you have no pair and no strong draw, the specific high cards you hold matter more than you'd think. Suited is better than unsuited. And counterintuitively, QJ is better than AQ because QJ can participate in more straights.

**What the player should learn:**
- Suited high cards (Qh Jh) >> unsuited high cards (Qs Jd) because of flush potential
- The 2-card unsuited hierarchy: QJ > KJ, KQ > AJ, AQ, AK
- Why: QJ makes straights in 3 positions (AKQJT, KQJT9, QJT98), AK makes only 1 (AKQJT)
- Never hold 3 unsuited high cards except for KQJ

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping AQ over QJ (the Ace restricts straight possibilities)
- Holding 3 unsuited high cards (AKQ) instead of the best 2 (KQ)
- Not valuing suited high cards enough

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Qh Jh 8c 5d 3s | Qh Jh | Suited QJ — best 2-card high card combo |
| 2 | Qs Jd 8c 5h 3d | Qs Jd | Unsuited QJ — still the best unsuited 2-card combo |
| 3 | As Kd 8c 5h 3s | As Kd | AK unsuited |
| 4 | Ah Qd Jc 6s 3h | Qd Jc | 3 unsuited high cards — drop the A, keep QJ |
| 5 | Kh Jc Qc 5d 2s | Qc Jc | Suited QJ — the suit makes this much stronger |
| 6 | 8s Jd Qc Ad 3d | Ad Jd | suited AJ — better than QJ offsuit |
| 7 | Kd Qh Jd 6c 2h | Kd Qh Jd | Suited KJ — better than QJ offsuit |
| 8 | Kd Qh Jc 6c 2h | Kd Jd | Unsuited KQJ — the only time you hold three high cards |
| 9 | Ah Kd Qs 7c 3d | Kd Qs | 3 high cards — drop the Ace, keep KQ
| 10 | 8s Jc Kd Ad 3d | Ad Kd | Suited AK — better than KJ offsuit ||

## Lesson 6: Suited Ten + High Card — 2 to a Royal with a Ten
*John Reviewed*

**Key concept:** When a Ten is suited with a Jack, Queen, or King, the combo becomes a "2 to a Royal Flush" draw with flush and straight potential on top. TJ suited is the strongest (most straight combinations), TK suited is the weakest. AT suited is NOT a real hold — the Ace alone is always better because A+T share only one straight (AKQJT).

**What the player should learn:**
- TJ suited, TQ suited, and TK suited are real holds worth keeping over garbage and lone high cards
- The ranking is TJ suited (best) > TQ suited > TK suited, driven by straight potential
- AT suited is NOT a valid hold — just keep the Ace
- TJ suited beats KJ unsuited — the suit's power overcomes the extra high card
- TQ suited beats AQ unsuited, but loses to KQ unsuited
- TK suited loses to all 2-unsuited-high-card combinations
- A low pair always beats any suited T+HC
- QJ unsuited beats even TJ suited

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding AT suited instead of just the Ace alone
- Breaking TJ suited to hold just the Jack — the suited Ten adds significant value
- Keeping KJ unsuited over TJ suited — TJ suited's flush and Royal potential outweighs the extra high card
- Not recognizing that the Ten's value comes from straight and flush potential, not from pairing (a Ten pair doesn't pay)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Th Jh 8c 5d 2s | Th Jh | TJ suited — best of the T+HC group, with 4 shared straights |
| 2 | Th Qh 9c 6d 3s | Th Qh | TQ suited — keep both for Royal, flush, and straight potential |
| 3 | Th Kh 9c 7d 4s | Th Kh | TK suited — weakest of the three but still better than a lone King |
| 4 | Th Ah 9c 7d 3s | Ah | AT suited is NOT a hold — just keep the Ace. A+T share only one straight |
| 5 | Th Jh Kd 6c 3s | Th Jh | TJ suited beats KJ unsuited — the suit overcomes the extra high card |
| 6 | Th Qh Ac 6d 5s | Th Qh | TQ suited beats AQ unsuited — the suit makes TQ stronger |
| 7 | Th Jh Qc 6d 3s | Qc Jh | QJ unsuited beats TJ suited — QJ is the best unsuited 2-card combo |
| 8 | Th Jh 5d 5c 3s | 5d 5c | Low pair of 5s beats TJ suited — a pair always wins here |
| 9 | Th Kh Ad 3c 2s | Ad Kh | AK unsuited beats TK suited — two high cards outweigh the suit |
| 10 | Th Qh Ks 3d 2c | Ks Qh | KQ unsuited beats TQ suited — K adds more value than the suited Ten |

## Lesson 7: Straight Draws - Level 1

*John reviewed*
**Key concept:** Not all straight draws are equal. An open-ended straight draw can be completed on either end (8 outs), while an inside straight draw needs one specific rank (4 outs). This distinction matters — open-ended draws are roughly twice as likely to hit.

**What the player should learn:**
- Open-ended straight draw (e.g., 7-8-9-T): Keep open-ended straight draw over high card
- Inside straight draw (e.g., 5-6-_-8-9): only 4 cards fill the gap, much weaker.  Never keep it with all low cards.
- Any pair is better than an open-ended straight draw.


**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Treating inside straight draws as valuable (they're usually not)
- Breaking a low pair for an inside straight draw
- Not recognizing that A-2-3-4 is an inside draw, not open-ended

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Jh Ts 9d 8c 3h | Jh Ts 9d 8c | Open-ended with a high card — good draw |
| 2 | 9h 8d 7c 6s Ks | 9h 8d 7c 6s | Open-ended — the K isn't helping |
| 3 | 5h 5d 8s 6c 7d | 5h 5d | Low pair is better than open-ended with no high cards |
| 4 | Jh Td Js 8c 9h | Jh Js | Keep the high pair |
| 5 | 8h 7d 5c 4s Kd | Kd | Inside draw (8-7-_-5-4) loses to a single high card |
| 6 | 6s 6d Jh Tc 9d | 6s 6d | Low pair is better than an inside straight draw |
| 7 | Th 9d 8c 6s 2d | Draw All | Never keep an inside straight draw |
| 8 | Ah 2d 3c 4s 9h | Ah | A-2-3-4 is an inside draw — just keep the Ace |

---

## Lesson 8: Straight Draws - Level 2 - 4 to Broadway — Inside Straights with High Cards
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Normally, inside straight draws are weak. But when all 4 cards are Broadway cards (Ten through Ace), the draw gets extra value: every card can pair up for a paying hand (Jacks or Better), and you're drawing to a straight. 

**What the player should learn:**
- AKQT, AKJT, AQJT are inside straights with 3+ high cards. In these scenarios, if you have two suited high cards keep it (i.e. AKs is better than AKQT).  If two cards are suited with a Ten, then keep all four (i.e. AKJT is better than ATs).
- These 4-card Broadway holds rank above holding just 2 unsuited high cards
- AKQJ.  Keep all four unless you have suited QJ.
- 
**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding only QJ offsuit from AKQJ (the 4-card inside straight is better than 2 high cards)
- Treating all inside straights the same — Broadway inside straights are special because of high card payout potential

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | As Kd Qh Tc 6s | As Kd Qh Tc | AKQT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs J) |
| 2 | As Kd Jh Tc 5s | As Kd Jh Tc | AKJT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs Q) |
| 3 | Ah Qd Jc Ts 6h | Ah Qd Jc Ts | AQJT inside straight — hold all 4 (needs K) |
| 4 | As Kd Qs Tc 6s | As Qs | AQ suited is better than AKQT |
| 5 | As Kh Jh Tc 5s | As Kh Jh Tc | KJ suites is better than AKJT |
| 6 | Ah Qd Jc Th 6c | Ah Qd Jc Th | AQJT is better than JT suited |
| 7 | As Kd Qd Jc 2c | As Kd Qd Jc | AKQJ is better than KQ suited |
| 8 | As Kd Qc Jc 5s | As Kd Qc Jc | QJ suited is better than AKQJ |

## Lesson 9: Straight Draws - Level 3 - Other Inside Straight Draws with High Cards.
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Normally, if you have two high cards and an inside straight draw you keep the high cards and don’t go for the inside straight, but there is an exception. 

**What the player should learn:**
- In hands that contain two high cards and an inside straight draw like KQT9 or QJT8, you just keep the two high cards. 
- If you have 3 high cards and an inside straight draw, you keep the inside straight draw.  The only example of this is KQJ9.
- 
**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Just keeping KQJ if you have KQJ9.
- Going for the inside straight draw with hands like QJT8.

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Kd Qh Tc 9h 6s | Kd Qh | KQ is better than the inside straight draw. |
| 2 | 8s Jd Qh Tc 5s | Jd Qh | QJ is better than the inside straight draw. |
| 3 | 9h Qd Jc Ks 6h | 9h Qd Jc Ks | KQJ9 is better than KQJ |

---

## Lesson 10: The KQJT Exception — When an Outside Straight Beats a Pair
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Lesson 7 taught that a pair beats an outside straight draw. KQJT is the one exception. With 3 high cards (K, Q, J) that each pay when paired plus 8 straight outs, KQJT. This only matters when the 5th card gives you a pair of Tens, since any other pair in this hand is a high pair (JJ, QQ, KK) which easily beats the straight draw.

**What the player should learn:**
- KQJT is the only 4-to-outside-straight that beats a low pair
- If your hand is KQJTT (pair of tens + KQJT straight), break the pair and hold KQJT
- If your hand has a high pair (JJ, QQ, or KK) alongside the KQJT cards, keep the high pair
- If 3 of the KQJT cards are suited, check for 3-to-a-Royal first — that's even stronger

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a pair of Tens over KQJT — the Tens don't pay when paired, and the straight draw is stronger
- Breaking a high pair of Jacks/Queens/Kings for the KQJT straight — the high pair always wins here
- Missing a 3-to-Royal hiding inside the hand (e.g., KsQsJs with Td)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Th Td Jc Qd Ks | Td Jc Qd Ks | KQJT beats pair of Tens — the one exception to "pairs beat straights" |
| 2 | Ts Tc Jd Qh Kc | Tc Jd Qh Kc | Same concept — break the Tens for the KQJT draw |
| 3 | Jh Jd Kc Qs Ts | Jh Jd | High pair of Jacks beats KQJT — high pairs always win |
| 4 | Qh Qd Kc Js Ts | Qh Qd | High pair of Queens beats KQJT |
| 5 | Kh Kd Qc Jd Ts | Kh Kd | High pair of Kings beats KQJT |
| 6 | Ks Qs Js Td Tc | Ks Qs Js | 3-to-Royal beats both KQJT and pair of Tens — always check for the Royal draw |

---

## Lesson 11: The 4-Card Flush — A Powerful Draw
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Four cards to a flush is one of the strongest drawing hands in the game. You have roughly a 1-in-5 chance of completing it (9 remaining suited cards out of 47). A 4-flush is better than a low pair but not a high pair.

**What the player should learn:**
- 4 to a flush is better than low pair: keep flush draw
- A high pair is better than 4 to a flush: keep high pair (JJ+)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low pair instead of drawing to the 4-flush
- Keeping two off-suit high cards instead of the 4-flush
- Breaking a high pair for a 4-flush (the high pair is better)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah 9h 6h 3h Kc | Ah 9h 6h 3h | 4 to a flush — discard the off-suit King |
| 2 | 8h 5h 3h 2h 8d | 8h 5h 3h 2h | 4 to a flush is better the pair of 8s |
| 3 | Qh 9h 7h 4h Ks | Qh 9h 7h 4h | 4 to a flush is better than the off-suit KQ |
| 4 | Kh Th 6h 2h Qs | Kh Th 6h 2h | 4 flush is better than a single high card (Q) |
| 5 | Jh 8h 4h 2h 5c | Jh 8h 4h 2h | 4 to a flush — even though J is high, the flush draw is much better |
| 6 | Qs Qd 8h 5h 3h | Qs Qd | High pair Queens is better than 3 to a flush — only 3 suited cards |
| 7 | Ts 6s 4s 2s 6d | Ts 7s 4s 2s | 4 to a flush is better than a low pair of 6s |
| 8 | Jd Jh 9h 7h 4h | Jd Js | High pair of Jacks is better than 4 to a flush |

## Lesson 12: Three to a Royal — When to Break Good Hands
*John Reviewed* 
**Key concept:** Three to a Royal Flush (3 cards T-or-higher of the same suit) is so powerful that it's correct to break a low pair and 4 to a straight.  However, a high pair is better than 3 to the royal.

**What the player should learn:**
- 3 to a Royal = 3 cards Ten-or-higher, all the same suit (e.g., Kh Qh Th)
- 3 to a Royal is better than: 4 to a  flush, 4 to a straight.
- 3 to a Royal is not as good as: two pair, trips, 4 to a straight flush
- You're not just chasing the Royal — on the redraw you can also hit a flush, straight, or pair

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping a low pair instead of 3 to a Royal
- Confusing 3 to a Royal (very strong) with 3 to a straight flush (much weaker)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Ah Kh Qh 7d 3c | Ah Kh Qh | 3 to a Royal — much better than 2 high cards |
| 2 | Kh Kd Kc Qh Jh | Kh Kd Kc | Trips are better than 3 to a Royal — keep the three Kings |
| 3 | Ah Kh Th 9d 4c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal — discard the garbage |
| 4 | Qh Jh Th 8c 5d | Qh Jh Th | 3 to a Royal — straightforward |
| 5 | Ks Qh Js Ts 4h | Ks Js Ts | 3 to a Royal in spades — don't keep the open-ended straight draw |
| 6 | Ah Kh Th 9h 3c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than 4 to a flush — yes, drop the 9h |
| 7 | Jh Tc Qh Th 6d | Qh Jh Th | Break the pair of Tens for 3 to a Royal |
| 8 | Kh Qh Th 8s 8d | Kh Qh Th | 3 to a Royal is better than a low pair of 8s |
| 9 | Kh Qh Th 9h 8d | Kh Qh Th | 4 to a Straight flush is better than 3 to a Royal|

## Lesson 13: Three to a Straight Flush — The Barely-There Draw (Type 3)
*John Reviewed*

**Key concept:** This is the first of three lessons on 3-to-a-straight-flush draws. Before diving in, two definitions: A **high card** is J, Q, K, or A — the cards that pay when paired in Jacks or Better. A **gap** is a missing rank between your held cards (e.g., 8-9-J has 1 gap where the T should be; 7-9-J has 2 gaps where the 8 and T should be). Type 3 is the weakest straight flush draw: 3 suited cards with **2 gaps and 0 high cards** (e.g., 3-5-7s, 4-6-8s). It barely beats throwing everything away — any single high card is a better hold.

**What the player should learn:**
- Type 3 = 3 suited cards with 2 gaps and no high cards (e.g., 3h 5h 7h, 4s 6s 8s)
- Type 3 beats: garbage only — it's the last thing you'd hold before discarding all 5
- Type 3 loses to: every single high card (J, Q, K, A)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding a type 3 draw over a lone Jack, Queen, King, or Ace
- Thinking "3 suited cards" must be good — type 3 is barely better than nothing

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 3h 5h 7h 9d 2s | 3h 5h 7h | Type 3 with pure garbage — barely better than discarding all 5 |
| 2 | 4h 6h 8h 9d 2s | 4h 6h 8h | Type 3 — hold the SF draw over nothing |
| 3 | 3h 5h 7h 8d Jd | Jd | Lone Jack beats type 3 — any high card is better |
| 4 | 4h 6h 8h Ad 3s | Ad | Lone Ace beats type 3 |

## Lesson 14: Three to a Straight Flush — The Middle Draw (Type 2)
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Type 2 is the middle-strength straight flush draw. It covers three patterns: **1 gap with 0 high cards** (e.g., 6-7-9s), **2 gaps with 1 high card** (e.g., 7-9-Js), or **ace-low** (e.g., A-3-5s). These are much stronger than Type 3 — they beat lone high cards, unsuited high card combos, and even suited T+HC draws. But they still lose to suited KQ/KJ and above.

**What the player should learn:**
- Type 2 = 1 gap/0 high, 2 gaps/1 high, or ace-low suited
- Type 2 beats: unsuited JQK, unsuited JQ, suited TJ, suited TQ, lone J/Q/K/A
- Type 2 loses to: Any two suited high cards

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Confusing Type 2 with Type 1 — the gap/high-card balance matters
- Holding suited TJ over a Type 2 draw — Type 2 is surprisingly stronger
- Breaking a Type 2 draw for a single unsuited high card — the SF draw wins

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 6h 7h 9h 4d 2s | 6h 7h 9h | Type 2: 1 gap, 0 high cards — basic hold |
| 2 | 7h 9h Jh 5d 2s | 7h 9h Jh | Type 2: 2 gaps, 1 high card |
| 3 | 6h 7h 9h Jd Qc | 6h 7h 9h | Type 2 beats unsuited JQ — the SF draw wins |
| 4 | 6h 7h 9h Ts Js | 6h 7h 9h | Type 2 beats suited TJ |
| 5 | 5s 6s 8s Ah Kh | Ah Kh | Suited KQ beats type 2 — the high cards outweigh the SF draw |
| 6 | 7h 9h Jh Ks Qd | 7h 9h Jh | Type 2 beats KQ unsuited and KQJ9 straight draw |

## Lesson 15: Three to a Straight Flush — The Strong Draw (Type 1)
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Type 1 is the strongest 3-to-a-straight-flush draw. The rule: **high cards >= gaps**. Consecutive suited cards (0 gaps) always qualify — like 5-6-7s or 7-8-9s. One-gap hands need at least 1 high card (e.g., 8-9-Js, 9-J-Qs). These are surprisingly powerful draws that beat most 2-card suited holdings, including suited AK.

**What the player should learn:**
- Type 1 = 3 suited cards where high card count >= gap count
- Consecutive suited cards (e.g., 7-8-9) are always type 1 — 0 gaps, so any number of high cards works
- 1-gap hands need at least 1 high card (e.g., 8-9-J suited, 9-J-Q suited)
- Type 1 Straight Flush draws beat: suited QJ, suited KQ/KJ, suited AK/AQ/AJ, inside straights with 3-4 high, and everything below
- Type 1 Straight Flush draws loses to: 4-to-outside straight, low pair, 4-to-flush, and everything above
- Surprising: 7-8-9 suited (EV 0.630) beats suited AK (EV 0.589)

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Holding suited QJ instead of the 3-to-SF type 1 that includes one of those cards
- Not recognizing that low consecutive suited cards (5-6-7) are still strong type 1 draws
- Breaking the 3-to-SF to hold a lone high card

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 7h 8h 9h 4d 2s | 7h 8h 9h | Consecutive suited — basic 3-to-SF type 1 |
| 2 | 9h Jh Qh 5d 2s | 9h Jh Qh | Strongest type 1 — 1 gap, 2 high cards |
| 3 | 8h 9h Jh 4d 2s | 8h 9h Jh | 1 gap, 1 high — still type 1 |
| 4 | 5h 6h 7h 4d 2s | 5h 6h 7h 4d | Open-ended Straight Draw is better than Type 1 Straight Flush Draw |
| 5 | 8h Jh Qh 5d 2s | 8h Jh Qh | 3-to-SF type 1 beats just holding QJ suited (the 8 adds SF potential) |
| 6 | 7h 8h 9h Qs Ks | 7h 8h 9h | Type 1 beats suited KQ — surprising but verified (EV 0.630 vs 0.589) |
| 7 | 7h 8h 9h Qs Js | 7h 8h 9h | Type 1 beats suited QJ — the SF draw is much stronger |
| 8 | 5h 5d 7s 8s 9s | 5h 5d | Low pair still beats type 1 — pairs are bread and butter |
| 9 | 9h Th Jh Qd 3s | 9h Th Jh Qd | 4-to-outside straight with one high card beats the 3-to-SF even with one high card — add the off-suit Q |
| 10 | 7h 8h 9h 3h Kd | 7h 8h 9h 3h | 4-to-flush beats 3-to-SF — take the extra flush card |

## Lesson 16: Garbage Hands
*John Reviewed*
**Key concept:** Sometimes you're dealt nothing — no pair, no draw, no high cards. Knowing when to throw away all 5 cards is a skill. This lesson also puts everything together.

**What the player should learn:**
- If you have nothing useful, discard all 5 and draw fresh
- A single high card (J, Q, K, A) is still better than keeping random low cards
- Don't keep 3 unsuited low cards hoping for a straight or flush — it won't happen often enough
- Review the full holding hierarchy from Lesson 1 through Lesson 15

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Keeping random suited low cards (e.g., 7h 4h 2h) — 3 to a flush is almost never worth it
- Not recognizing true garbage (no pair, no draw, no high cards)
- Getting "attached" to an almost-hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Lesson |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 8c 6d 4h 3s 2c | Nothing | Pure garbage — discard all 5 |
| 2 | 9h 7d 5c 3s 2h | Nothing | No pair, no draw, no high card — toss it |
| 3 | Jh 4d 3c 2s 8h | Jh | Lone Jack — better than garbage |
| 4 | Qh 9h 7d 4c 2s | Qh | Lone Queen — only high card in the hand |
| 5 | 9d 7c 5h 3s 2d | Nothing | Garbage — fresh 5 cards is the best play |
