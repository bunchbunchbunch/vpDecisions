# 9/6 Jacks or Better Lesson Plan

## Philosophy

Teach the strategy from the ground up, starting with the easiest decisions (pat hands, obvious pairs) and building toward the subtler ones (high card combos, penalty cards). Each lesson introduces one core idea, reinforces it with examples, and tests it with practice hands.

---

## Lesson 1: Pat Hands — Know When You've Already Won

**Core idea:** If you're dealt a paying hand (Two Pair or better), you almost always keep all five cards. The only exception worth learning early is 4 to a Royal Flush.

**What to teach:**
- Straights, Flushes, Full Houses, and above are "pat" hands — keep them
- Two Pair: always keep both pairs (never break up two pair hoping for a flush)
- The one big exception: 4 to a Royal beats everything except a pat Royal or Straight Flush

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Jh Th 9h 8h 7h | All 5 | Straight flush — never break this |
| 2 | Ks Kd Kh 7c 7s | All 5 | Full house — keep it |
| 3 | Ah 9h 6h 3h 2h | All 5 | Flush — even a low flush, keep it |
| 4 | Ts 9d 8c 7h 6s | All 5 | Straight — keep it, don't chase a flush draw |
| 5 | Qh Qd 8s 8c 3d | All 5 | Two pair — never break two pair |
| 6 | Ah Kh Qh Jh 5s | Ah Kh Qh Jh | 4 to a Royal beats keeping the pair or chasing other draws |
| 7 | Kh Kd Ks 6c 6d | All 5 | Full house — even though you have three Kings, keep the full house |
| 8 | Th 9h 8h 7h 2c | Th 9h 8h 7h | 4 to a straight flush — worth breaking nothing for, but worth noting the draw |
| 9 | As Ks Qs Js 4d | As Ks Qs Js | 4 to a Royal — discard the 4, not close |
| 10 | Ah Kd Qc Js Th | All 5 | Straight — even an ace-high straight, keep it (no flush draw to tempt you) |

---

## Lesson 2: Pairs Are Your Bread and Butter

**Core idea:** A pair is almost always worth keeping. High pairs (Jacks through Aces) are paying hands. Low pairs (2s through 10s) aren't paying, but they're still better than most drawing hands.

**What to teach:**
- High pair (JJ, QQ, KK, AA): this pays 1-for-1, hold it almost always
- Low pair (22–TT): doesn't pay, but the chance to improve to two pair/trips/full house/quads makes it better than holding random high cards
- Three of a kind: always hold just the three (draw two fresh cards for a chance at quads or a full house)
- Low pair beats: an inside straight draw, 2 unsuited high cards, a single high card
- Low pair loses to: 4 to a flush, 4 to an open-ended straight with high cards

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Qh Qd 7s 4c 2d | Qh Qd | High pair — paying hand, keep the Queens |
| 2 | 6h 6d As Kc 3s | 6h 6d | Low pair beats two unsuited high cards (AK) |
| 3 | 9s 9d Jh Tc 3c | 9s 9d | Low pair — don't be tempted by the J or the JT combo |
| 4 | 5h 5d 5c Qs 8d | 5h 5d 5c | Three of a kind — hold the trips, draw 2 |
| 5 | Ah Ad Kh Kd 3s | Ah Ad Kh Kd | Two pair — keep both pairs, draw one |
| 6 | 7h 7d Tc 9s 8d | 7h 7d | Low pair beats an inside straight draw (T-9-8 needs a J or 6) |
| 7 | Ks Kd 4h 3h 2h | Ks Kd | High pair beats 3 to a flush (not enough cards to make it) |
| 8 | Jh Jd Th 9h 3c | Jh Jd | High pair beats 4 to an open-ended straight — close, but pair of Jacks wins |
| 9 | 4c 4d Ah Qs 9h | 4c 4d | Low pair beats AQ unsuited — this surprises beginners |
| 10 | Ts Td Tc Jh 2d | Ts Td Tc | Three of a kind — even with a Jack kicker, just hold the trips |

---

## Lesson 3: Chasing the Flush (4-Card Flush Draws)

**Core idea:** Four to a flush is one of the strongest drawing hands. It beats a low pair and even beats a high pair in some situations. But it doesn't beat everything.

**What to teach:**
- 4 to a flush: draw one card, ~1 in 4.7 chance to complete
- 4 to a flush beats: a low pair, any single high card, 2 high cards, 3 to a straight flush
- 4 to a flush loses to: high pair (JJ+), two pair, trips, 4 to a straight flush, 4 to a royal
- When you have both a low pair AND a 4-flush, ditch the pair and draw to the flush

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Ah 9h 6h 3h Kc | Ah 9h 6h 3h | 4 to a flush — discard the off-suit King |
| 2 | 8d 8s 7h 5h 3h 2h | — | (Reworked below) |
| 2 | 8h 5h 3h 2h 8d | 8h 5h 3h 2h | 4 to a flush beats a low pair of 8s |
| 3 | Jd Js Th 7h 4h 3h | — | (Reworked below) |
| 3 | Jd Js 7h 4h 3h | Jd Js | High pair of Jacks beats 3 to a flush — not enough suited cards |
| 4 | Qh 9h 7h 4h Kc | Qh 9h 7h 4h | 4 to a flush — the off-suit K is a trap |
| 5 | Kh Th 6h 2h Qs | Kh Th 6h 2h | 4 to a flush beats a single high card (Q) |
| 6 | 5s 5d Jh 8h 4h 2h | — | (Reworked below) |
| 6 | Jh 8h 4h 2h 5c | Jh 8h 4h 2h | 4 to a flush — even though J is a high card, the flush draw is much better |
| 7 | Ah Kh Qh 5h Jd | Ah Kh Qh 5h | 4 to a flush — also has 3-to-royal inside it, but you keep all 4 suited cards |
| 8 | Qs Qd Th 8h 5h 3h | — | (Reworked below) |
| 8 | Qs Qd 8h 5h 3h | Qs Qd | High pair Queens beats 3 to a flush |
| 9 | 6d 6c Ts 7s 4s 2s | — | (Reworked below) |
| 9 | Ts 7s 4s 2s 6d | Ts 7s 4s 2s | 4 to a flush beats a low pair of 6s |
| 10 | Kh Jh 8h 4h 9c | Kh Jh 8h 4h | 4 to a flush — much stronger than just keeping KJ |

---

## Lesson 4: Straight Draws — Open vs. Inside

**Core idea:** Not all straight draws are equal. An open-ended straight draw (can be completed on either end) is much better than an inside straight draw (needs one specific card to fill a gap). And high cards in your straight draw matter.

**What to teach:**
- Open-ended straight draw (e.g., 7-8-9-T): can be completed two ways, decent draw
- Inside straight draw (e.g., 5-6-8-9): only one rank fills the gap, much weaker
- Open-ended straight draw with high cards beats a low pair
- Inside straight draw almost always loses to a low pair
- 4 to a straight with no high cards is weaker — consider what else is in your hand

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Jh Ts 9d 8c 3h | Jh Ts 9d 8c | Open-ended straight draw with a high card — good draw |
| 2 | 9h 8d 7c 6s Ks | 9h 8d 7c 6s | Open-ended straight draw — the K isn't helping |
| 3 | Ts 9d 7c 6h 2s | 6h 7c 9d Ts | Inside straight draw (missing the 8) — still better than nothing here, but weaker |
| 4 | 5h 5d Ts 9c 8d | 5h 5d | Low pair beats an open-ended straight with no high cards (T-9-8) |
| 5 | Jh Td 9s 8c 2h | Jh Td 9s 8c | Open-ended J-T-9-8 — strong draw with a high card |
| 6 | 8h 7d 5c 4s Kd | Kd | Inside straight draw (8-7-5-4 missing the 6) loses to just keeping the King |
| 7 | Qh Jd Ts 8c 3d | Qh Jd Ts | 3 high cards to a straight — keep QJT, discard the rest |
| 8 | 6s 6d Jh Tc 9d | 6s 6d | Low pair beats an inside straight draw |
| 9 | Th 9d 8c 7s Ad | Th 9d 8c 7s | Open-ended T-9-8-7 — better than holding just the Ace |
| 10 | Kh Qd Jc 9s 4d | Kh Qd Jc | Inside straight (K-Q-J-9, need a T) — but holding KQJ as high cards is better than the 4-card draw |

---

## Lesson 5: High Card Strategy — The Tricky Stuff

**Core idea:** When you have no pair, no draw, and just high cards — the specific combination matters more than you'd think. Suited beats unsuited. And counterintuitively, QJ is better than KQ, and KQ is better than AK.

**What to teach:**
- Suited high cards (e.g., Qh Jh) are much better than unsuited (Qs Jd) because of flush potential
- Fewer high cards is often better: QJ makes more straights than AK (QJ can be in AKQJT, KQJT9, QJT98 — AK can only be in AKQJT)
- The hierarchy for 2 unsuited high cards: QJ > KJ > KQ > AJ > AQ > AK
- Never hold 3 unsuited high cards — hold the best 2 (usually drop the Ace)
- A single Jack is better than a single Ace (same payout but more straight possibilities)
- When you hold a lone Ace, you're hoping to pair it — but Aces only make one straight (A-K-Q-J-T)

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Qh Jh 8c 5d 3s | Qh Jh | Suited QJ — best 2-card high card combo (flush + straight potential) |
| 2 | Qs Jd 8c 5h 3d | Qs Jd | Unsuited QJ — still the best 2-card unsuited combo |
| 3 | As Kd 8c 5h 3s | Kd | AK unsuited — surprisingly, just keeping the K is better than keeping AK |
| 4 | Kh Qd Js 7c 2h | Qd Js | Three unsuited high cards — drop the King, keep QJ (more straights) |
| 5 | Ah Qd Jc 6s 3h | Qd Jc | Three unsuited high cards — drop the Ace, keep QJ |
| 6 | Kh Jh 9c 5d 2s | Kh Jh | Suited KJ — the suit makes this much stronger than unsuited |
| 7 | As 9d 7c 4h 2s | As | Lone Ace — only option when nothing else connects |
| 8 | Jd 8c 5h 3s 2d | Jd | Lone Jack — better straight potential than a lone Ace |
| 9 | Kd Qh 9s 6c 2h | Kd Qh | Unsuited KQ — keep both, but know this is weaker than QJ |
| 10 | Ah Kd Qs 7c 3d | Kd Qs | Three high cards — drop the Ace, keep KQ (Ace restricts straights) |

## Lesson 6: Three to a Royal — When to Break Good Hands

**Core idea:** Three to a Royal Flush is a powerful draw. It's so strong that it's often correct to break a paying hand — including a high pair, a flush, or even a straight — to chase the Royal.

**What to teach:**
- 3 to a Royal = 3 cards Ten-or-higher of the same suit
- 3 to a Royal beats: high pair, flush, straight
- 3 to a Royal loses to: two pair, trips, full house, 4 to a royal, straight flush, 4 to a straight flush
- This is the decision that separates good players from average players
- You're not just chasing the Royal — you can also hit a flush, straight, or high pair on the redraw

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Ah Kh Qh 7d 3c | Ah Kh Qh | 3 to a Royal — much better than just holding two high cards |
| 2 | Kh Kd Kc Qh Jh | Kh Kd Kc | Three Kings — 3 of a kind beats 3 to a Royal (Kh Qh Jh) |
| 3 | Qs Qd Qh Jh Th | Qs Qd Qh | Trips beat 3 to a Royal — keep the three Queens |
| 4 | Jh Jd Th Kh 5c | Jh Kh Th | Break the pair of Jacks! 3 to a Royal (Kh Jh Th) is stronger |
| 5 | Ah Kh Jh 9d 4c | Ah Kh Jh | 3 to a Royal — discard the garbage |
| 6 | Qh Jh Th 8c 5d | Qh Jh Th | 3 to a Royal — straightforward, just take the draw |
| 7 | Kd Qs Js Ts 4h | Qs Js Ts | 3 to a Royal in spades — discard the off-suit King |
| 8 | Ah Kh Th 9h 3c | Ah Kh Th | 3 to a Royal beats 4 to a flush (Ah Kh Th 9h) — yes, really! Drop the 9h |
| 9 | Jh Jc Qh Th 6d | Jh Qh Th | Break the pair of Jacks for 3 to a Royal (Qh Jh Th) |
| 10 | Kh Qh Th 8s 8d | Kh Qh Th | 3 to a Royal beats a low pair of 8s — easy decision |

## Lesson 7: Garbage Hands & Putting It All Together

**Core idea:** Sometimes you're dealt a hand with nothing — no pair, no draw, no high cards. Knowing when to throw away all 5 cards is a skill. This lesson also tests everything you've learned.

**What to teach:**
- If you have nothing (no pair, no flush draw, no straight draw, no high cards) — discard all 5
- A single high card is still better than 3 random suited low cards
- Don't get sentimental about "almost" hands — if it's not in the strategy, let it go
- Review: the rough hierarchy of what beats what

**Practice Hands:**

| # | Hand | Correct Hold | Why |
|---|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | 8c 6d 4h 3s 2c | Nothing | Garbage — discard all 5, draw fresh |
| 2 | 9h 7d 5c 3s 2h | Nothing | No pair, no draw, no high cards — throw it all away |
| 3 | Ts 8d 6c 4h 2s | Ts | Ten is not a high card in JoB (Jacks or Better) — but actually, discard all here |
| 4 | 9h 8h 5d 3c 2s | 9h 8h | Suited 9-8 — only slightly better than discarding all, but the suited combo has some straight flush potential |
| 5 | Jh 4d 3c 2s 8h | Jh | Lone Jack — better than garbage |
| 6 | 7h 7d Kc 6s 2c | 7h 7d | Low pair — review: always better than a single high card |
| 7 | Qh 9h 7d 4c 2s | Qh | Lone Queen — only high card in the hand |
| 8 | Kd Td 8s 5c 2h | Kd Td | Suited K-T — the suit gives you flush + straight potential |
| 9 | As Kh Qd Jc 4h | Kh Qd Jc | Four high cards — drop the Ace, keep the best 3 (actually keep KQJ over AKQJ) |
| 10 | 9d 7c 5h 3s 2d | Nothing | Pure garbage — fresh 5 cards is the best play |
