## Key Observations

### Most Common Strategic Conflicts (excluding single high card decisions)

1. **4 to a flush vs Low pair** (2,540 hands) - Classic flush draw vs pair decision
2. **Low pair vs 3 to SF type 1** (2,275 hands) - Keep the pair or chase the straight flush?
3. **Unsuited JQK vs 2 unsuited high K highest** (1,995 hands) - Three high cards vs two
4. **Unsuited JQ vs 2 unsuited high A highest** (1,936 hands) - JQ vs AJ/AQ/AK
5. **4 to a flush vs 3 to SF type 1** (1,638 hands) - Flush draw vs straight flush draw
6. **Low pair vs Suited KQ or KJ** (1,557 hands) - Pair vs suited royals
7. **Suited KQ/KJ vs Unsuited JQK** (1,516 hands) - Suited two vs unsuited three

### Rare but Important Conflicts

- **4 to royal flush vs Straight** (6 hands) - Break a made straight for royal draw
- **Straight vs 4 to a flush** (3 hands) - Very rare overlap
- **4 to SF vs Unsuited TJQK** (5 hands) - Straight flush draw vs broadway

## Strategy Reference

The lower rank number always indicates the better play. For example, in "High pair (11) vs 3 to royal (12)", keeping the high pair (rank 11) is correct over the 3 to a royal flush draw (rank 12).
